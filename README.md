# White_Wine_Quality_Analysis
This explores machine learning classification techniques on the White Wine Quality dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository . The goal is to predict the quality of white wine based on its physicochemical properties such as alcohol content, acidity, sugar, and density.

The repository includes:
- Data exploration and visualization: Histograms, scatter plots, and a correlation heatmap to understand relationships between features and wine quality.
- Preprocessing: Standardization of features to improve model performance.
- Machine learning model: Logistic Regression for classification of wine quality.
- Evaluation: Model accuracy and confusion matrix for performance assessment.

This project is suitable for beginners in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning, demonstrating how to preprocess data, visualize patterns, and implement a classification algorithm.
